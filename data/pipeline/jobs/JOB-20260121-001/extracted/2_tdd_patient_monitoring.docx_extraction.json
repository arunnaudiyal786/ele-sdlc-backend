Technical Overview\nThe Real-Time Patient Monitoring System is a distributed architecture designed to collect, process, and visualize patient vital signs from medical IoT devices. The system uses an event-driven microservices architecture with real-time streaming, complex event processing for alerts, and FHIR-compliant data storage.\n2. Architecture Pattern\nEvent-Driven Microservices + Pub/Sub Pattern + CEP (Complex Event Processing)\n3. Technical Components\nPython: Backend services and CEP engine\nFastAPI: REST API layer\nPostgreSQL + TimescaleDB: Time-series vitals storage\nApache Kafka: Event streaming backbone\nMQTT Broker (Mosquitto): IoT device communication\nRedis: Real-time alert cache and session storage\nReact + TypeScript: Web dashboard\nReact Native: Mobile apps (iOS/Android)\nWebSockets: Real-time dashboard updates\nHL7 FHIR SDK: Healthcare data standards\n4. Design Decisions\nUse MQTT for device communicati...",
