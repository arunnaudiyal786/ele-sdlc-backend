Include device authentication via X.509 certificates, message validation, protocol translation, and fault-tolerant message buffering.\nAcceptance Criteria\n1. MQTT broker (Mosquitto) deployed with TLS 1.3 and certificate-based device auth\n2. Device adapters for 5 manufacturers parse proprietary protocols to standard vitals format\n3. Vitals messages validated against HL7 FHIR Observation schema\n4. Message buffering handles up to 1 hour of device disconnect\n5. Device connection status monitored with heartbeat mechanism\n6. End-to-end latency from device to Kafka topic is <2 seconds\n7. Unit tests cover all device adapters with 90% coverage\nTechnical Notes\nUse paho-mqtt library for MQTT client connections\nImplement adapte...",
