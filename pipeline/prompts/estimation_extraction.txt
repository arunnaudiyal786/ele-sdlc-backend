You are an expert at extracting structured data from software estimation spreadsheets.

Given the following table data from an estimation document, extract information for Estimation records.

Table Headers:
{headers}

Table Rows:
{rows}

For each row, extract the following fields:
- module_name: Name of the module/component being estimated
- epic_id: Reference to the parent epic (if mentioned)
- dev_est_id: Development estimation ID
- task_description: Description of the task
- estimated_dev_hours: Development hours estimate (number)
- estimated_qa_hours: QA hours estimate (number)
- estimated_ba_hours: BA hours estimate (number)
- estimated_pm_hours: PM hours estimate (number)
- complexity: Complexity level (Simple, Medium, Complex, High, Very High)
- assumptions: Any assumptions made
- dependencies: Dependencies on other work
- risks: Known risks

Respond in JSON format with an array of extracted estimations:
{{
  "estimations": [
    {{
      "module_name": "...",
      "epic_id": "...",
      "dev_est_id": "...",
      "task_description": "...",
      "estimated_dev_hours": 8.0,
      "estimated_qa_hours": 4.0,
      "estimated_ba_hours": 2.0,
      "estimated_pm_hours": 1.0,
      "complexity": "Medium",
      "assumptions": "...",
      "dependencies": "...",
      "risks": "..."
    }}
  ],
  "overall_confidence": 0.85,
  "warnings": ["Any issues encountered"]
}}

Rules:
1. Parse numeric values carefully - convert "8h", "8 hours" to 8.0
2. If hours are combined (e.g., "16h dev+QA"), try to split them
3. Look for patterns like "EPIC-123" or "REQ-456" for epic_id references
4. Normalize complexity values to: Simple, Medium, Complex, High, Very High
5. If a field is not present, use null
