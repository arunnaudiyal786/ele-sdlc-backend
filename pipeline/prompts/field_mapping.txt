You are an expert at mapping source document fields to target schema fields.

Given the following source fields extracted from a document:
{source_fields}

And the target schema with these fields:
{target_fields}

Suggest mappings from source fields to target fields.

For each target field, identify:
1. The best matching source field (if any)
2. Confidence score (0.0-1.0) for the mapping
3. Brief reasoning for the mapping

Consider:
- Field names may be abbreviated or use different conventions
- Values might need transformation (dates, numbers, enums)
- Some source fields may map to multiple target fields
- Some target fields may have no matching source field

Respond in JSON format:
{{
  "mappings": [
    {{
      "source_field": "dev_hours",
      "target_field": "estimated_dev_hours",
      "confidence": 0.95,
      "source_value": "8h",
      "reasoning": "Field names match semantically, value is numeric hours"
    }},
    {{
      "source_field": "owner",
      "target_field": "epic_owner",
      "confidence": 0.85,
      "source_value": "John Smith",
      "reasoning": "Owner field maps to epic_owner, contains person name"
    }}
  ],
  "unmapped_target_fields": ["field1", "field2"],
  "unmapped_source_fields": ["extra_field"],
  "transformation_notes": [
    "dev_hours needs parsing: '8h' -> 8.0",
    "date fields need YYYY-MM-DD normalization"
  ]
}}

Mapping priority:
1. Exact name match (highest confidence)
2. Semantic similarity (e.g., "dev_hours" -> "estimated_dev_hours")
3. Value type match (date, number, text patterns)
4. Context clues from surrounding data
