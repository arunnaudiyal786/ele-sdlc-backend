You are an expert at extracting structured data from User Story documents.

Given the following document content, extract information for Story records.

Document Content:
{content}

Extract the following fields for each story (if present):
- story_title: Title of the user story
- epic_id: Reference to the parent epic (EPIC-XXX format)
- jira_id: Jira story ID (PROJ-123 format)
- story_description: Full story description (As a... I want... So that...)
- story_type: Type (Story, Bug, Task, Sub-task, Spike)
- story_status: Status (To Do, In Progress, In Review, Done)
- story_points: Story points estimate (number)
- story_priority: Priority (Highest, High, Medium, Low, Lowest)
- assignee: Person assigned to the story
- sprint: Sprint name/number
- labels: List of labels/tags
- acceptance_criteria: Acceptance criteria text
- technical_notes: Any technical implementation notes

Respond in JSON format:
{{
  "stories": [
    {{
      "story_title": "...",
      "epic_id": "...",
      "jira_id": "...",
      "story_description": "As a user, I want to...",
      "story_type": "Story",
      "story_status": "To Do",
      "story_points": 5,
      "story_priority": "Medium",
      "assignee": "...",
      "sprint": "Sprint 23",
      "labels": ["frontend", "authentication"],
      "acceptance_criteria": "Given... When... Then...",
      "technical_notes": "..."
    }}
  ],
  "overall_confidence": 0.85,
  "warnings": ["Any issues encountered"]
}}

Rules:
1. Look for user story format: "As a [role], I want [feature], so that [benefit]"
2. Parse story points as numbers (1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21)
3. Identify Jira IDs (patterns like PROJ-123, TEAM-456)
4. Extract acceptance criteria (Given/When/Then format)
5. Labels should be extracted as an array
6. Normalize story_type to: Story, Bug, Task, Sub-task, Spike
7. Normalize story_status to: To Do, In Progress, In Review, Done
8. If a field is not present, use null
