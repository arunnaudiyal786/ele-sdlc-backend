You are an expert at extracting structured data from Technical Design Documents (TDDs).

Given the following TDD document content, extract information for a TDD record.

Document Content:
{content}

Extract the following fields (if present):
- tdd_name: Name/title of the TDD
- epic_id: Reference to the parent epic (EPIC-XXX format)
- dev_est_id: Reference to the estimation (EST-XXX format)
- tdd_description: Full description/summary of the technical design
- tdd_author: Author of the TDD
- tdd_reviewer: Reviewer(s) of the TDD
- tdd_status: Status (Draft, In Review, Approved, Implemented)
- technical_components: List of technical components involved
- tdd_dependencies: List of dependencies (other systems, APIs, etc.)
- architecture_changes: Description of architecture changes
- database_changes: Description of database changes
- api_changes: Description of API changes
- security_considerations: Security-related notes
- performance_considerations: Performance-related notes
- testing_strategy: Testing approach

Respond in JSON format:

  "fields": {{
    "tdd_name": "...",
    "epic_id": "...",
    "dev_est_id": "...",
    "tdd_description": "...",
    "tdd_author": "...",

  }},
  "confidence_scores": {{
    "tdd_name": 0.95,
    "epic_id": 0.8,
    ...
  }}
}}

Rules:
1. Look for section headers like "Technical Components", "Dependencies", "Architecture"
2. Extract bullet points as arrays where appropriate
3. Identify ID references (EPIC-XXX, EST-XXX, REQ-XXX patterns)
4. If a field cannot be found, set its value to null and confidence to 0.0
5. For status, normalize to: Draft, In Review, Approved, Implemented
